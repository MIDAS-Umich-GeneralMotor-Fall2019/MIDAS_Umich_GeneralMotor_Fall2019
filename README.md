Process of turning a ‘raw’ part into a ‘ﬁnished’ part involves several dozen intermediary steps. The following figure gives an illustration of the crank. The best process would have the least variation in the polisher stock removed (making it easier to control the ﬁnal size by monitoring the grinding machines). To achieve the goal, we need to determine:
- Signiﬁcant drivers of the stock removal variation.
- Whether discovered characteristics  are common across all 10 journals.
